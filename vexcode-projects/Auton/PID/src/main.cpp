// To complete the VEXcode V5 Text project upgrade process, please follow the
// steps below.
// 
// 1. You can use the Robot Configuration window to recreate your V5 devices
//   - including any motors, sensors, 3-wire devices, and controllers.
// 
// 2. All previous code located in main.cpp has now been commented out. You
//   will need to migrate this code to the new "int main" structure created
//   below and keep in mind any new device names you may have set from the
//   Robot Configuration window. 
// 
// If you would like to go back to your original project, a complete backup
// of your original (pre-upgraded) project was created in a backup folder
// inside of this project's folder.
